## 📦 Dependencies

> ⚠️ Please install the following dependencies before running the app.  
> I had some issues adding them in Xcode directly, so please add them manually if needed:

- [`RxDataSources`](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxDataSources)
- [`Kingfisher`](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher)

You can use Swift Package Manager (SPM) to add them manually:
1. Open **Xcode > File > Add Packages...**
2. Add:
   - `https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxDataSources`
   - `https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher`
